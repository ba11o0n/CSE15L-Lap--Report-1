          2. Copy the account name that is listed uner the section *Additional Accounts* that begins with cs15l as the first five characters. Then, at the top of the page, a highlighted box in light yellow will tell you to reset your password using the [link](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/password.php).
